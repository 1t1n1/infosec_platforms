### Solution

This challenge was a simple UAF. You want to overwrite a variable (`x`) so that it contains the string "pico" and you can ask the program to free the variable. You can also ask to allocate a new chunk of arbitrary size as well as specify the content the new chunk should hold. Therefore, the solution is to free `x`, ask to malloc a chunk of the same size as `x` (which will yield `x`'s freed chunk) and overwrite the data of the chunk so that it contains the "pico" string we are looking for. We can then ask for the flag and we will successfully receive it.
