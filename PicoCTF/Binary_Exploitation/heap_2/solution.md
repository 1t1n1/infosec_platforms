### Solution

For this challenge, it was necessary to know that the program doesn't use ASLR and that it was not activated on the server either. Using the same technique as the previous challenge (overflow a heap chunk to overwrite the next chunk's content) we are able to set the address of `win` as the value of `x`. It is then possible to retrieve our flag using the `Print Flag` function.

#### Key points

- Heap chunks are contiguous
