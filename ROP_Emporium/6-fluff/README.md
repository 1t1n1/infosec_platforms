The trick here was to not overlook any instruction. Indeed, instructions like `xlatb`, `bextr` and `stosb` were either not listed among the gadgets found by tools such as ROPgadget or ropper, or were simply easy to overlook while looking at the list because these are instructions that are not often encountered and thus likely not known or well understood. These types of weird instructions also often arise when the disassembler has a hard time disassembling and so it is easy to link weird instructions with wrong disassembly, but that is not the case here and the challenge was to understand this.
